# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


I applied Socket.IO for this chat app to communicate between clients and servers.
In application.py, I created routes for index, and socketio for my event.
For the website template, I was able to create ChatAppPage.html that includes JavasSript and Jquery, as well as add styling to my chat app.
For rendering template, ChatAppPage.html, I searched for https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/ and I copies and pastes the basic template from there.
In this website, the user gets to enter their name and message.
By applying Socket.IO, a chat room is created.
I also used Bootstrap CDN.
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/  --> I went to here to get icon for "arrow down"
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#forms  --> I went here to get form template

I have completed display name, messages view, sending messages and some personal touch. I have not fullfilled the requirements competely as I would have liked, but I see the power of Flask and how the Socket.IO Javascript library can be used for realtime web applications.
Thank you for taking the time to grade my project.
I hope that you have a nice summer.
